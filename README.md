**tuatara** is [ziggidy](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) **\*nix** system info fetcher. WIP.
it is descendant of [disfetch](https://github.com/q60/disfetch), although sharing some common concepts and principles, they are different.

the main difference of **tuatara** from **disfetch** is that tuatara will be highly customizable, while disfetch won't, because it covers minimalism and simplicity. though, they will share some other principles regarding showing only needed information, being fast and reliable and sharing the same handmade logos with the principle of *not-more-or-less-than* 8 rows.

Wikipedia says: “**Tuatara** are [reptiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile) [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), belonging to the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) ***Sphenodon***. Although resembling most [lizards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard), they are part of a distinct lineage, the order [Rhynchocephalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynchocephalia). Their name derives from the [Māori language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language), and means ‘peaks on the back’”.

*stay moist, stay ziguana, use tuatara*
